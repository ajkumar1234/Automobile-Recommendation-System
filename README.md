# 🚗 Car Brand & Model Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the most probable **car brand and model** based on user inputs such as **price** and **fuel type**. It applies supervised machine learning techniques to learn pricing patterns across different car manufacturers and segments.

The problem is formulated as a **multi-class classification task**, where brand and model are combined into a single target variable to enable prediction using a single ML model.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- Input Features:
  - Car Price (Numerical)
  - Fuel Type (Categorical)
- Target:
  - Combined Brand and Model label
- Algorithm:
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluation:
  - Train–test split with unseen data validation

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Feature encoding and transformation  
3. Train-test data splitting  
4. Model training using Random Forest  
5. Model evaluation  
6. Real-time prediction through a web interface
